# Face_Mask_Detection

The widespread adoption of face masks has become a critical measure to mitigate the spread of airborne diseases, especially during pandemics like COVID-19. 
However, ensuring consistent adherence to mask-wearing protocols in public spaces remains a significant challenge. 
This project aims to develop a real-time, automated face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
The system processes live video feeds, detects faces, and determines mask compliance with high accuracy, even under varying environmental conditions such as low lighting. 
By integrating advanced deep learning techniques and leveraging efficient hardware configurations,the model ensures robust performance in high-risk environments.
